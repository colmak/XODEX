# BURZEN TD v0.00.4.1

## Focus updates
- Added standardized tower selection settings metadata (targeting + replacements + heat scaling) into the Godot v0.00.4 mockup selection flow.
- Added wave simulation with randomized mob compositions per level/wave and terrain profile influence.
- Added heat-aware damage resolution model so tower output is contextually reduced by mob heat and terrain bias.
- Added Python-side mechanic tests for randomized creep setups, terrain heat, and tower setting option coverage.
