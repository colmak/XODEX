# BURZEN Tower Defense Prototype (XODEX)

Open-source Android + simulation prototype for **BURZEN TD**, currently tracked as:

- **Runtime milestone:** `v0.00.5.0` (typed-script hardening, demo campaign flow, thermal tower mechanics)
- **Latest published release notes:** `v0.00.4.1` (`docs/releases/v0.00.4.1.md`)
- **Design/scene expansion baseline:** `v0.00.4.0` (mockup scene tree + UI wiring + expanded tower taxonomy scaffolding)

This repository intentionally keeps **prototype runtime stability** and **forward design experiments** side by side so contributors can iterate without blocking core gameplay.

It now also includes a **serverless web module** for text-link level exchange, hosted via GitHub Pages under `docs/`.

---

## Quick Start (contributors)

1. Open `android/BurzenTD/project.godot` in **Godot 4.6.1.stable**.
2. Press **Play** to boot the main menu, or choose **Demo Campaign** for curated tutorial levels.
3. Run local validation before pushing changes:

```bash
./scripts/run_tests.sh
```

For CLI regression simulation focused on the demo campaign shell, run:

```bash
android/BurzenTD/tests/cli_sim/cli_regression.sh
```

### Quick Start (GitHub Pages web module)

1. Open `docs/index.html` through GitHub Pages or a local static server.
2. Go to `docs/editor/` to build a level in-browser.
3. Generate a link and share it as text.
4. Recipients open `docs/play/#XDX1...` and play instantly.

Run locally:

```bash
python -m http.server 4173 --directory docs
```

## 1) Project Status and Versioning

### Current stable gameplay layer (`v0.00.5.0`)
Implemented in the primary Godot scenes/scripts and simulation modules:

- Touch-first placement loop
- Thermal overheat/recovery tower state behavior
- Procedural wave/path progression shell
- Win/loss state transitions and menu flow
- Deterministic simulation test coverage for baseline mechanics

### Forward prototype layer (`v0.00.4.0` draft)
The repository includes a **Godot UI/scene mockup** for the planned expansion:

- Expanded tower catalog UI (geometric + elemental + keystone classes)
- Placement safety concept (NESOROX-style safe-state rollback checks)
- Mock mob stats overlays and settings panel structure
- Integration notes for future GDScript and optional GDNative/Haskell bridge

> Important: `v0.00.4.0` assets are currently **prototype scaffolding**, not yet full gameplay parity with the stable `v0.00.5.0` runtime loop.

### Versioning policy
BURZEN TD uses incremental pre-1.0 semantics:

- `v0.00.x.y` where:
  - `x` = feature increment (prototype scope expansion)
  - `y` = patch/prototype refinement
- Stable gameplay claims are made only when reflected in both:
  1. runtime scenes/scripts
  2. automated simulation/regression checks

---

## 2) Implemented Capabilities (Today)

### Web text-link exchange capabilities (`docs/`)
- Browser editor with grid path authoring, wave authoring, and heat budget input
- Deterministic 2D Canvas player with fixed timestep loop
- URL-fragment level exchange (`#XDX1.<payload>.<checksum>`), no backend/API
- Compact schema codec with compression and checksum validation
- Corruption/tamper rejection and hard safety caps in the decoder/validator
- Fork flow: open a play link in editor, modify, re-encode, reshare

### Gameplay/runtime capabilities
- Main menu and level routing shell
- Procedural path variants and level progression
- Wave spawning and enemy traversal
- Life tracking, score accumulation, retry/next/menu transitions
- Tap placement, spacing/path safety constraints, long-press highlight behavior

### Simulation capabilities
- Thermal pressure and overheat state transitions
- Basic wave scaling and mechanics checks
- Deterministic checks suitable for CI-style gating

### Expansion-ready capabilities
- Additional tower taxonomy and metadata schema
- UI container structure for collapsible tower/settings panels
- Mock event points for safety-state projection and wave composition overlays

## 3) Architecture at a Glance

- **Godot app root:** `android/BurzenTD/`
- **Runtime scenes:** `android/BurzenTD/scenes/`
- **Runtime scripts:** `android/BurzenTD/scripts/`
- **Python simulation tests:** `simulation/`
- **Prototype formal experiments (Haskell):** `simulation/haskell/`
- **Product/engineering docs:** `docs/`
- **GitHub Pages web module:** `docs/index.html`, `docs/editor/`, `docs/play/`, `docs/core/`

Design principle: keep rendering/input logic in Godot while preserving deterministic mechanics models in simulation layers for rapid verification.

For the web module, design principle is: **all state client-side, URL-encoded, deterministic replay behavior, and zero backend dependencies**.

## 4) Web Module Technical Overview (Text-Link Level Exchange)

### Hosting model
- Static hosting only (GitHub Pages serving `docs/`)
- No database, no API, no server authority
- Share payload is carried entirely in URL fragment

### Core files
- `docs/core/schema.json` — canonical Level Schema v1
- `docs/core/codec.js` — serialize/compress/encode/checksum/decode/validate
- `docs/core/game.js` — deterministic browser game loop
- `docs/editor/main.js` — level editor and share-link generator
- `docs/play/main.js` — token load, validation, and play boot

### Encoding flow
`level object -> compact schema -> JSON -> LZ-style compression -> base64url -> checksum -> versioned token`

Token format:
`#XDX1.<payload>.<checksum8>`

### Validation and safety caps
- Grid size, path length, wave count, spawn counts, and heat are bounded
- Rejects malformed, negative, NaN, or Infinity values
- Rejects checksum mismatches and unsupported versions
- Fails closed with `Invalid or corrupted level.` rather than crashing

### Determinism rules
- Fixed simulation timestep in the browser loop
- Seeded pseudo-random helper derived from token
- No backend-authoritative corrections

### URL budget target
- Encoder enforces a maximum token size budget (1200 chars target)
- Supports practical sharing over SMS/Discord/email

---

## 5) Build & Validation

### Build Android APK
```bash
./scripts/build_apk.sh
```

Prerequisites:
1. Godot 4 with Android export templates
2. Android signing/export settings in `android/BurzenTD/export_presets.cfg`

### Run full local validation gate
```bash
./scripts/run_tests.sh
```

This executes simulation tests plus release metadata/export dry-run checks.

## 6) Controls (Current Runtime)

### Menu
- **Play:** starts a procedural run from Level 1
- **Settings:** placeholder/UI status behavior
- **Quit:** exits app

### Gameplay
- **Tap on empty space:** place tower (up to configured max)
- **Long-press tower:** trigger heat highlight pulse
- **Two-finger tap:** retry current level seed

### Web player controls

## 8) Cross-Compatible Open-Source Implementation Notes

BURZEN TD is prototype-focused, but intentionally aligns with widely used open-source game/sim stacks for easier contributor portability.

### Engine and scripting compatibility
- **Godot 4.x (MIT):** primary runtime and UI composition model
  - SceneTree + signal architecture maps directly to BURZEN tower/mob/event hooks
  - GDScript-first approach keeps iteration speed high for prototype balancing
- **GDNative/GDExtension ecosystem:** supports extending hot paths in native languages
  - BURZEN’s deterministic state hooks can be exported to native modules without rewriting scene layouts

### Deterministic simulation and balancing
- **Python test ecosystem (CPython + unittest/pytest-compatible workflows):**
  - Simple reproducible combat/thermal regressions
  - Easy CI integration for balancing assertions
- **Haskell prototype path (GHC/runghc):**
  - Strong fit for pure-state transition experiments (SPOC/NESOROX-style modeling)
  - Useful for proving candidate placement/wave policies before porting to GDScript

### Data-oriented compatibility approach
BURZEN tower/mob specs are represented as serializable dictionary-like structures in prototype scripts. This makes migration straightforward to:

- JSON/YAML balancing pipelines
- ECS-style component models
- External wave/tower tuning tools

### Open-source projects/pattern families BURZEN can interoperate with
(Reference families for implementation style; not direct bundled dependencies.)

- **Godot demo/project patterns** for TD/pathing UI composition
- **OpenRA-style deterministic RTS/TD simulation thinking** (state-first, deterministic outcomes)
- **Mindustry-style data-driven unit/tower tuning workflows**
- **Luanti/Minetest modding philosophy** for rapid gameplay extension through scriptable primitives

These references are included to encourage contributors to adopt familiar open-source design heuristics while keeping BURZEN’s own architecture and naming stable.

## 10) Future Design Goals (near/mid-term)

### Web module goals
- Expand editor UX with touch-first path editing and richer wave presets
- Add optional service worker/offline caching for resilient mobile play
- Add decentralized lineage metadata (`r`) tooling for explicit fork ancestry
- Keep schema compatibility stable for future Godot client ingestion

### Shared goals across web + Godot
- Maintain one canonical level schema for all clients
- Preserve deterministic gameplay semantics across runtimes
- Improve balance tooling and visualization without introducing backend coupling

### Godot-specific goals
- Continue 3D/advanced rendering exploration as optional enhancement client
- Reuse same level schema + codec semantics where platform allows

---

## 11) Roadmap Snapshot

- **v0.00.4.x:** expanded tower classes + richer overlays + safer placement/state checks
- **v0.00.5.x:** adaptive wave composition and stronger mob defense typing
- **v0.01.0:** deeper WASMUTABLE-style rule shifts and specialization systems
- **Web text-link track:** stronger editor ergonomics + schema continuity + share-flow hardening

---

## 12) Repository Hygiene

- Simulation logs go under `simulation/logs/` (ignored except marker files)
- Signing keys (`*.jks`, `*.keystore`) must remain out of source control
- APK/AAB artifacts under `builds/<version>/` remain ignored unless explicitly staged for release flow
